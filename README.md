Create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and automate the deployment process with GitHub Actions.
Project Flow

Introduction
This GitHub project provides a comprehensive guide and a set of resources to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions.

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

Whereas GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and CI/CD platform provided by GitHub.

By combining Terraform and GitHub Actions, you can:

Define Infrastructure as Code: Define your infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, databases, and networks, in a Terraform configuration file.

Automate Deployment: Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy your infrastructure whenever there are changes to your Terraform configuration.

Version Control: Keep your infrastructure code version-controlled and easily collaborate with your team.

Infrastructure as Code Best Practices: Follow best practices for infrastructure as code, including versioning, code review, and documentation.

This project serves as a starting point for your infrastructure automation journey, providing a basic structure and guidelines to build upon.
